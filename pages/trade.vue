      Clear your shelves of the PTFE petrochemical products, and stock Green Oil (or at least give cyclists the Green Oil option).
      <br>
      If you want to support a company that's doing good, want biolubricants and bicycle maintenance products that really work and don't want dodgy chemicals around your mechanics, your customers, or the world we live in, you're in the right place.
      Welcome to Green Oil UK!
      <br>
      Your mechanic will thank you too for not filling his body with PTFE and petrochemicals! See our distributors below, or call us.
